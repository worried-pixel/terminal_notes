                                ABOUT ME
===============================================================================

WHO I AM
========
Systems administrator and infrastructure specialist with 25 years of hands-on
experience across the full evolution of modern computing:

Windows NT → Linux → Virtualization → Cloud-native architectures

I specialize in understanding how complex systems fit together, fail, recover,
and evolve over time.

My strength is not syntax — it is system design.

                                  ABOUT ME
===============================================================================

IDENTITY
========
I am a systems architect and infrastructure specialist with ~25 years of
hands-on experience across the evolution of modern computing:

- Windows NT / early enterprise systems
- Linux and UNIX administration
- Networking and infrastructure operations
- Virtualization and cloud-native paradigms
- Developer tooling and workflow design

I am the kind of engineer who keeps systems alive, understands why they fail,
and designs them so they fail safely.

I am not a traditional software developer by background.
I am a systems thinker.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE JOURNEY
===========
For most of my career, I was steadily employed, solving real operational and
infrastructure problems.

Then came an unexpected break:
- Long-term joblessness
- No financial safety net
- Limited hardware
- No formal CS degree
- No active development environment

What remained:
- Deep system understanding
- Time
- And access to AI tools

This constraint forced an unconventional path.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE PIVOT
=========
I did not try to "learn coding faster".

Instead, I asked a different question:

"What if architecture, invariants, and intent mattered more than syntax?"

I began designing systems first — fully in my head — and used AI purely as
an execution engine.

I do not write Python.
I still cannot write "Hello World" unaided.

Yet I designed and shipped a complete, working system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROOF OF WORK: TERMINAL NOTES
=============================
Terminal Notes is a full-system, research-grade project built in ~35 days using
AI as the sole implementation agent.

What I personally contributed:
- System architecture
- Data model design
- Temporal identity guarantees
- Failure and recovery semantics
- Navigation and interaction models
- Invariant enforcement
- Feature prioritization under constraint

What AI contributed:
- Mechanical code implementation
- Syntax translation
- Boilerplate execution

The result is not a demo.
It is a functioning system solving problems people usually write papers about.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT I DEMONSTRATED
===================
TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES:
- Temporal database thinking
- Item-level identity tracking
- Git as a generalized storage engine
- Recovery-first system design
- Modular architecture across 9 coordinated components
- Terminal UI design for deep hierarchies
- Search and resurrection across time

METHODOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES:
- Architecture-first development
- AI-directed implementation
- Conceptual debugging without syntax reliance
- Maintaining coherence across large systems
- Building under extreme constraints

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT THIS SAYS ABOUT HOW I WORK
===============================
I am strongest when:
- The problem is ambiguous
- Constraints are real
- Systems must survive failure
- Tradeoffs matter
- Long-term correctness matters more than speed

I value:
- Invariants over features
- Simplicity over cleverness
- Understanding over frameworks
- Systems that explain themselves

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENT REALITY
===============
- Status: Unemployed
- Resources: Minimal
- Project state: Proof-of-concept complete
- Capability ceiling reached without external support

Terminal Notes works.
The architecture is sound.
Further progress now requires stability, not insight.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT I AM SEEKING
=================
PRIMARY:
- Systems architecture roles
- Developer tools or infrastructure teams
- AI-assisted development leadership
- Knowledge management or temporal systems work

SECONDARY:
- Collaboration on research-grade systems
- Organizations exploring AI + architecture workflows
- Teams that value proof-of-work over credentials

I am open to:
- Full-time roles
- Contract work
- Meaningful technical collaboration

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT I BRING
============
IMMEDIATE VALUE:
- Proven ability to design and ship complex systems alone
- Rare ability to direct AI instead of being led by it
- Deep operational and architectural intuition
- Calm problem-solving under pressure

LONG-TERM VALUE:
- Mentorship in systems thinking
- Architectural leadership
- Process innovation using AI
- Resilient, principled engineering culture

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FINAL NOTE
==========
This repository is not just code.

It is evidence:
- That architecture still matters
- That deep understanding outlives syntax
- That AI amplifies those who know what to build
- That innovation can come from unexpected places

I am not asking for sympathy.
I am offering capability.

This project reimagines Git not as file-based version control, but as an
item-level temporal database with full history preservation across renames,
moves, deletions, and structural changes.

Core Innovations:
-----------------
• UUID-based item identity embedded in Git commits
• Item-level history that survives renames and hierarchy changes
• git log --grep used as a temporal query language
• Infinite hierarchical notebooks (no depth limits)
• Instant numeric navigation (J1 / J2 / J3 teleportation)
• Unified search across current, deleted, and historical items
• Complete resurrection of deleted hierarchies with full context
• Modeless time travel UI ([HISTORICAL] / [RESURRECTED] indicators)
• Terminal-native, keyboard-first interface with adaptive layout

Architecture:
-------------
• 9 coordinated modules (3000+ lines)
• Database engine + UI framework + search + recovery system
• Three-file schema separating structure from content
• Atomic writes, crash recovery, and production-grade error handling

This is not a prototype — it is a working proof-of-concept.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW IT WAS BUILT
================
• No formal computer science degree
• No Python background (cannot write “Hello World”)
• Built in 35 days, ~18 hours/day
• Implemented entirely using AI assistance

I did not learn to code.
I designed systems precisely enough for AI to implement them.

This project demonstrates a specification-first, architecture-driven
AI-assisted development methodology.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT THIS DEMONSTRATES
======================
Technical Capabilities:
-----------------------
• Systems architecture and modular design
• Temporal data modeling and querying
• Recovery-oriented engineering
• User interface design for complex information systems

Methodology:
------------
• AI-assisted development leadership
• Conceptual debugging without direct coding
• Constraint-driven innovation
• Proof-of-work over credentials

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE UNFINISHED VISION
====================
This project was originally intended as a full startup:

Phase 1: Core temporal database (COMPLETE)
Phase 2: Real-time collaboration using CRDTs over Git (DESIGNED)
Phase 3: Cloud synchronization and conflict resolution (ROADMAPPED)
Phase 4: Desktop and mobile applications (PLANNED)
Phase 5: Plugin ecosystem and enterprise features (VISIONED)

Development stopped not due to lack of vision, but lack of resources.

The architecture supports all future expansion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENT REALITY
===============
• Unemployed for over a year after a lifetime of stable work
• Operating under severe financial constraints
• Limited hardware, no formal development environment

Despite this, the system works completely and demonstrates all core ideas.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT I’M SEEKING
================
Primary Need:
-------------
Stability — the foundation that allows innovation to continue.

Professional Interests:
-----------------------
• Systems architecture and infrastructure roles
• Developer tools and version control innovation
• AI-assisted development leadership
• Knowledge management and temporal data systems

Collaboration:
--------------
• Teams working on Git, databases, developer tools
• Organizations valuing proof-of-work over credentials
• Research groups exploring human–AI collaboration

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT I BRING
============
Immediate Value:
----------------
• Proven systems thinking
• Ability to ship under extreme constraints
• AI collaboration methodology
• Deep infrastructure intuition

Long-Term Value:
----------------
• Technical leadership
