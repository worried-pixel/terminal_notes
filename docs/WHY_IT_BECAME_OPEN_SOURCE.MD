                         WHY THIS IS OPEN SOURCE
================================================================================

This project did not begin as an open-source experiment.

It began as a long-term product idea built to solve a personal and persistent
problem: existing note-taking and knowledge tools could not represent how
information actually evolves over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORIGINAL INTENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The original plan was to build a complete, opinionated system around these ideas:

- Item-level identity instead of file-level tracking
- Infinite hierarchical organization without artificial limits
- Temporal search across current, historical, and deleted data
- Safe experimentation through full resurrection and time travel
- Terminal-first interaction for speed and density

The architecture was intentionally designed to support future work such as:

- Collaboration
- Conflict-free merging
- Encryption
- Synchronization
- Multiple user interfaces

In other words, this was planned as a startup-grade system, not a prototype.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY DEVELOPMENT STOPPED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project was developed under severe resource constraints.

Despite having a clear roadmap and a working core architecture, continued
development became unsustainable due to practical limitations unrelated to
the technical direction of the project.

There was no lack of ideas.
There was no architectural dead end.
There was simply no runway.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY OPEN SOURCE WAS THE RIGHT DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At this point, there were two options:

1. Let the work remain private and unfinished
2. Share the ideas and implementation openly

Open-sourcing was chosen because:

- The core innovations already exist and work
- The concepts may be useful beyond this specific application
- Others may learn from or build upon the architecture
- The work can stand on its own as a technical demonstration

This repository is shared not as a product,
but as a reference implementation and a systems experiment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE PROJECT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is not abandonware.

The code reflects:
- deliberate design decisions
- real-world usage
- constraints-driven engineering

Future development may happen, or it may not.
The value of this repository does not depend on its continuation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A NOTE ON MOTIVATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project exists because the problem mattered enough to be built anyway,
even without guarantees of success or sustainability.

Open-sourcing it ensures the work itself is not lost.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLOSING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If this repository helps someone think differently about:

- version control
- temporal data
- knowledge systems
- system architecture in the AI-assisted era

then making it public has already served its purpose.
