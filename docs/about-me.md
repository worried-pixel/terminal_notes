                                ABOUT ME
===============================================================================

WHO I AM
========
Systems administrator and infrastructure specialist with 25 years of hands-on
experience across the full evolution of modern computing:

Windows NT → Linux → Virtualization → Cloud-native architectures

I specialize in understanding how complex systems fit together, fail, recover,
and evolve over time.

My strength is not syntax — it is system design.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT I BUILT
============
TERMINAL NOTES — a complete temporal database system built on Git.

This project reimagines Git not as file-based version control, but as an
item-level temporal database with full history preservation across renames,
moves, deletions, and structural changes.

Core Innovations:
-----------------
• UUID-based item identity embedded in Git commits
• Item-level history that survives renames and hierarchy changes
• git log --grep used as a temporal query language
• Infinite hierarchical notebooks (no depth limits)
• Instant numeric navigation (J1 / J2 / J3 teleportation)
• Unified search across current, deleted, and historical items
• Complete resurrection of deleted hierarchies with full context
• Modeless time travel UI ([HISTORICAL] / [RESURRECTED] indicators)
• Terminal-native, keyboard-first interface with adaptive layout

Architecture:
-------------
• 9 coordinated modules (3000+ lines)
• Database engine + UI framework + search + recovery system
• Three-file schema separating structure from content
• Atomic writes, crash recovery, and production-grade error handling

This is not a prototype — it is a working proof-of-concept.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW IT WAS BUILT
================
• No formal computer science degree
• No Python background (cannot write “Hello World”)
• Built in 35 days, ~18 hours/day
• Implemented entirely using AI assistance

I did not learn to code.
I designed systems precisely enough for AI to implement them.

This project demonstrates a specification-first, architecture-driven
AI-assisted development methodology.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT THIS DEMONSTRATES
======================
Technical Capabilities:
-----------------------
• Systems architecture and modular design
• Temporal data modeling and querying
• Recovery-oriented engineering
• User interface design for complex information systems

Methodology:
------------
• AI-assisted development leadership
• Conceptual debugging without direct coding
• Constraint-driven innovation
• Proof-of-work over credentials

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE UNFINISHED VISION
====================
This project was originally intended as a full startup:

Phase 1: Core temporal database (COMPLETE)
Phase 2: Real-time collaboration using CRDTs over Git (DESIGNED)
Phase 3: Cloud synchronization and conflict resolution (ROADMAPPED)
Phase 4: Desktop and mobile applications (PLANNED)
Phase 5: Plugin ecosystem and enterprise features (VISIONED)

Development stopped not due to lack of vision, but lack of resources.

The architecture supports all future expansion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENT REALITY
===============
• Unemployed for over a year after a lifetime of stable work
• Operating under severe financial constraints
• Limited hardware, no formal development environment

Despite this, the system works completely and demonstrates all core ideas.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT I’M SEEKING
================
Primary Need:
-------------
Stability — the foundation that allows innovation to continue.

Professional Interests:
-----------------------
• Systems architecture and infrastructure roles
• Developer tools and version control innovation
• AI-assisted development leadership
• Knowledge management and temporal data systems

Collaboration:
--------------
• Teams working on Git, databases, developer tools
• Organizations valuing proof-of-work over credentials
• Research groups exploring human–AI collaboration

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT I BRING
============
Immediate Value:
----------------
• Proven systems thinking
• Ability to ship under extreme constraints
• AI collaboration methodology
• Deep infrastructure intuition

Long-Term Value:
----------------
• Technical leadership
• Architectural mentorship
• Process innovation
• Resilient problem-solving mindset

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FINAL NOTE
==========
This is not a request for sympathy.

It is an invitation to evaluate real work, real systems thinking, and a
demonstrated ability to solve hard problems under pressure.

The code speaks for itself.
